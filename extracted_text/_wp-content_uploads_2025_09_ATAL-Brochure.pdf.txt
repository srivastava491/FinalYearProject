This Institute was conferred upon the status of Deemed University on June 26, 2002. Since then it has been named as National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra. The Institute is a residential campus well known for its dedicated faculty, staff and state- of-the-art infrastructure. The Institute offers B. Tech, M. Tech., M.C.A., M.B.A and Ph.D. programs. The Institute enjoys an excellent placement service for its graduate and post graduate students. ABOUT KURUKSHETRA Kurukshetra- the land of the Mahabharata has traditionally been the epicentre of learning. The message of Bhagavad Gita is believed to have been delivered by Lord Krishna at this place. In addition to its spiritual significance, the city of Kurukshetra has steadily developed into a center of academic excellence. ABOUT DEPARTMENT: The branch of Electronics and Communication Engineering was started in the year 1971 under the aegis of Electrical Engineering Department. The “Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering” came into existence in the year 1973. In 1987, Computer Engineering branch was also started and the department was renamed as “Electronics, Communication and Computer Engineering”. In 2003, the department was again renamed as “Electronics and Communication Engineering” because of inception of “Computer Engineering Department” separately. The department is well equipped with the state of the art laboratories and research facilities in almost all the domain of ECE engineering. Currently, the department is offering B Tech, M Tech and PhD Courses. The PhD course is offered in the various specializations like Wireless Communication, Optical Communication, MIMO systems, Photonics Crystal Fiber Sensors, Security, Signal Processing, Speech Processing, VLSI, Embedded Systems, and applications of AI/ML in various fields of electronics and communication, etc. OBJECTIVES OF THE PROGRAM The Faculty Development Program (FDP) on "Next-Gen Electronics and Communication Systems: Empowered by ML and AI" is designed to upskill faculty members with the latest advancements in electronics, communication, and intelligent systems. The primary objective is to provide a strong foundation in the integration of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) into electronics and communication engineering (ECE) applications. The program aims to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation by offering hands-on sessions with modern tools and platforms. It encourages curriculum enhancement, promotes interdisciplinary research, and supports innovation in teaching methodologies. The FDP also seeks to familiarize participants with real-world case studies, cutting-edge research trends, and industry applications. Moreover, it emphasizes the importance of ethical and responsible use of AI/ML technologies in critical systems. Through expert interactions and collaborative activities, the program aspires to prepare faculty to mentor students in building future-ready solutions in ECE. COURSE OUTCOMES: By the end of the Faculty Development Program on "Next- Gen Electronics and Communication Systems: Empowered by ML and AI", participants will have gained a comprehensive understanding of how Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be effectively integrated into modern electronics and communication engineering (ECE) systems. Faculty members will be equipped with both theoretical insights and practical skills through immersive hands-on sessions using contemporary tools and platforms. Participants will be able to:  Incorporate ML and AI concepts into their teaching curriculum to better align with current technological advancements.  Design and guide interdisciplinary research projects that leverage intelligent systems in ECE applications.  Implement innovative and ethical teaching methodologies that reflect industry needs and academic rigor.  Analyze and interpret real-world case studies and emerging trends to inform both academic and applied research efforts.  Serve as capable mentors for students, encouraging the development of next-generation, AI-driven solutions in the field of electronics and communication.  Overall, the program will empower faculty to become catalysts for technological innovation, curriculum modernization, and responsible AI integration within academic and professional contexts. TARGET PARTICIPANTS: The faculty members, Research scholars & PG Scholars of the AICTE approved institutions and Industry Personnel ATAL FDPs are completely free for participants. RESOURCE PERSONS: Distinguished and Learned persons from Institutes of repute including IITs, NITs, IIITs and experts from related industries will be the resource persons for this course. Minimum 50% experts from industry. At least 02 overseas experts. REGISTRATION FEES: There is no registration fee for the workshop. Limited numbers of seats are available. Therefore, the participants will be selected on first-come-first-serve basis. ATAL FDPs are completely free for participants. For more details on FDP, please refer to https://aicte-india.org/atal/
