With the introduction of the programme, the Institute extends its long years of expertise into the field of Business Administration, thus fulfilling its commitment to the business world and the society at large of developing professional managers with varied competencies and ethical values. In a short span, the MBA program has made a mark for itself. It has all the ingredients of a successful program: a strong curriculum, comparable with the very best; well qualified and dedicated faculty, a batch of talented and enthusiastic students; emphasis on case-based interactive study, supported by all modern teaching aids; liaison with industry; active participation in inter- & intra-institution competitions, etc. Training & Placement: (i) The first batch enjoys the unique opportunity of receiving Summer Training from reputed Universities/B-Schools and industries in three European countries – Switzerland, Germany & Holland. This exceptional experience would help the students widen their horizon 3 and provide them much valued international exposure. A similar opportunity will be available to the subsequent batches as well. (ii) As a result of the Institute’s legacy of over 40 years as a premier centre of technical education, it has enjoyed the reputation of placing 100% of its graduating students, many in more than one organization. We expect to carry this legacy forward in our MBA programme as well. MSc. Programs <details to be updated> PhD Program <details to be updated soon>.
