Central Workshop – National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra Central Workshop The Central Workshop of our Institute is a vital facility that provides hands-on training and practical experience to students, particularly in their early years of study. It is a multidisciplinary hub designed to familiarize students with various manufacturing processes, tools, machines, and safety protocols. Typically divided into multiple labs such as machining, production technology (PT), fitting, welding, pattern making, foundry, computer aided manufacturing (CAM), the Central Workshop serves as a foundation for developing essential technical skills. Under the guidance of experienced instructors, students learn how to interpret engineering drawings, handle tools, operate machines, and understand production techniques. The workshop plays a crucial role in bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, fostering a deeper understanding of engineering principles and encouraging problem-solving, creativity, and innovation. It also supports project work, prototype development, and research activities across various departments. In summary, the Central Workshop is an indispensable part of engineering education, contributing significantly to the holistic development of future engineers. Sr. No. Name of Labs Key Facilities 01.
