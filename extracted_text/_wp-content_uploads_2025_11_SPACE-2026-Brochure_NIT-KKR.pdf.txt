The conference will explore innovative approaches in urban and regional planning, architectural design, and civil engineering practices that ensure environmental stewardship, economic viability, and social well-being. With rapid urbanization and climate change posing unprecedented challenges, SPACE 2026 aims to foster dialogue among academicians, industry leaders, researchers, and policymakers to develop solutions that are cost-effective, disaster-resilient, energy-efficient, and resource-conscious. The event will encourage the exchange of cutting-edge research, sustainable construction technologies, and policy frameworks that can guide the creation of smart, resilient cities and infrastructure systems. By integrating principles of sustainability into the full infrastructure life cycle—from planning and design to construction, operation, and decommissioning, SPACE-2026 aspires to inspire transformative strategies for a greener, smarter, and more resilient future. Call for Papers The International Conference on Sustainable Planning, Architecture and Civil Engineering (SPACE 2026) invites original, high-quality research contributions from academia, industry, and policy sectors that align with the conference themes but not limited to. The aim is to bring together experts from diverse backgrounds to share innovative ideas, research findings, and practical solutions for sustainable urban planning, architectural innovation, and resilient infrastructure development.
