Registration is mandatory for any student who wants to participate in the placement or internship process. However, it is not obligatory for every student; only those desiring placement or internship assistance need to register. Students who choose not to register at the beginning of the session will typically not be allowed to participate in on-campus placement and internship drives. Candidates must provide their contact and academic information to the Training & Placement Cell for the master resume in the prescribed format. Failure to submit the required information within the notified schedule may result in non-registration for campus placement or internship assistance. The Training & Placement Cell will monitor the information provided by students throughout the placement process. Any ambiguous, incorrect, misleading, or fraudulent information may lead to the student being debarred from the placement process and may also result in disciplinary action. 4.1.1 Eligibility criteria for students to enroll for the placement Full-time students of the Institute who meet the following criteria are eligible to seek placement assistance by registering with the Training & Placement Cell: 1. They are expected to complete all requirements for their enrolled program in the current session. 2. They have not been debarred from participating in the campus placement process by any competent authority of the institute. 3. They do not have any active reappear or UMC status. Only final results published on the institute's website will be considered. Additionally, self-sponsored students are permitted to participate in placement drives. Sponsored candidates registered in any program at the institute must provide a No-Objection Certificate from their current employers. Without this certificate, they will not be included in campus placements. 4.1.2 Document Submission Guidelines Students should keep soft copies of the following documents readily available: 1. Updated resume 2. Institute ID card 3. Aadhar card 4. PAN card 5. Passport-sized photo 6. 10th and 12th grade certificates 7. Provisional grade card up to the latest semester result These documents should be shared with hiring companies as required. Students are advised to upload only their resume, provisional grade card, and student ID card to the placement portal. Additionally, students must bring hard copies of all relevant documents whenever a campus drive is scheduled. Requests for printouts or photocopies from the T&P Office will not be accommodated. 4.1.3 Guidelines for Resume The recommended resume template is available on the website. Students must use this template for all campus placement opportunities. If a student provides false information on their resume or makes false declarations when required, they will be barred from participating in the next five consecutive placement opportunities. The resume should be renamed as follows: “NIT-KKR-BRANCH-ROLLNO-FIRSTNAME - LASTNAME-resume” and saved in PDF format only. Resumes that do not adhere to these guidelines will not be shared with the company. 4.1.4 Guidelines for Offline Interview Placement aspirants must adhere to the following dress code for all campus engagement activities, including PPTs, online tests, seminars, and interviews: 1.

Ensure proper lighting and minimize any possible distractions or movements in the interview room. 3. Any attempt at cheating, plagiarism, or misbehaviour will be treated as an unfair practice. Appropriate disciplinary action, including possible debarment from further placement processes, will be taken. 4.2 Invitation to Companies for Campus Placement Drives The Training & Placement Cell is dedicated to supporting students of the institute with placements and internships. We strive to invite and host as many companies as possible for recruitment drives. To facilitate this, we maintain and regularly update a list of companies that have previously visited the institute for recruitment purposes. We will begin inviting companies for placement and internship drives at the start of each placement session. Our communication will include a brief profile of the institute and a Job Notification Form (JNF), which can be downloaded from JNF. Companies interested in campus recruitment should express their interest via email and submit a completed JNF in the prescribed format. The JNF should detail the job profiles, remuneration packages, and eligibility requirements. It serves as an introduction to the job profiles for candidates and outlines the company's requirements. Companies may submit multiple JNFs for different positions. These should be sent to the Training & Placement Cell at tnpoffice@nitkkr.ac.in or tpo@nitkkr.ac.in. Changes to the package or eligibility criteria from those outlined in the JNF will not be entertained. Any deviations from the JNF during the placement drive must be reported to the Training & Placement Cell. Modifications to the JNF information will only be permitted with the Training & Placement Cell's agreement. Companies will be allocated slots/dates for conducting their placement process, which may include Pre- Placement Talks (PPTs), written tests, online tests, group discussions, and personal interviews. Companies must confirm their selection process before the specified date; otherwise, the slot may be offered to other companies. Requests for changes in slots can be accommodated based on availability. Companies may request information/resumes from interested students and shortlist candidates before the placement process begins. The shortlisting criteria must be communicated in advance. 4.3 Announcement of JNF/ INF & Online Company Registration Once the Training & Placement Cell receives the JNF(s) from interested companies, the details will be announced through appropriate channels. Students should review the information regarding the company, job profiles, packages, and eligibility criteria. Students interested in participating in the placement or internship drive for a specific company must register for the drive within the specified timeframe. This registration is separate from the general student registration done before the placement season and must be completed for each visiting company. Students who fail to register for a company’s placement drive will generally not be considered for that company at a later stage. Students who withdraw or fail to participate in the selection process after registering without a valid reason will be debarred from participating in the placement process. 4.4 Eligibility check and notification of student list At the end of the registration deadline for the respective placement/internship drives, the Training & Placement Cell will carry out scrutiny as per the eligibility requirements mentioned by the company in the JNF received and Training & Placement Cell records. A list of eligible students for the respective placement drive will be notified to the students using the suitable medium. This list of eligible students for the respective placement drive/ job profiles shall also be shared with the company. 4.5 Slot allotment to the company as per available schedule All companies, upon expression of interest and submission of JNFs, will be allotted available slots/ dates for carrying out respective placement drives as per the institute policy. The preference for allotment of slots/ dates to the companies will be on the basis of a matrix comprising of:  Package offered  No branches covered  Number of selections done in the previous year(s), if any  Participation in placements in previous year(s), if any Suitable slots shall be offered to the companies as per the criteria mentioned above and confirmed by the company in consultation with the Training & Placement Cell. 4.6 Selection process by the Company Companies may design their selection process at their discretion, which can include a combination of Pre-Placement Talks (PPTs), written tests (technical/aptitude), group discussions, technical interviews, and HR interviews. The Training & Placement Cell expects companies to communicate the details of their selection process and its components well in advance to ensure smooth execution. The Training & Placement Cell will provide the necessary infrastructure and assistance, such as informing students and arranging test materials and centres. While the Cell may assist with the conduct of tests (subject to volunteer availability), companies are strongly encouraged to send their representatives to oversee and proctor these tests. Companies are generally required to provide a shortlist of students for interviews (based on student profiles and/or test performances) to the Training & Placement Cell at least one hour before the interviews begin. The Training & Placement Cell will then notify the shortlisted students about the interview schedule once it is finalized. 4.7 Announcement of the Selection Result The final selection of the students for the placement shall be made only from the interviewed candidates. It should be noted that the selected candidates must have participated in all rounds of the selection process. It is expected that the company will provide a list of finally selected students to the Training & Placement Cell at the end of the day/ slot itself. In case further rounds of interviews are required to be held, the same should be communicated to the Training & Placement Cell along with the list of short- listed candidates (such information should also be provided in the initial JNF submitted). The list of selected/short-listed students should be duly signed by the responsible authority or can be sent to tnpoffice@nitkkr.ac.in, tpo@nitkkr.ac.in from an official/ company email ID. No ‘on-the-spot’ offers should be made directly to the students, and neither should students be given any indication of the selection during or immediately after the selection process. The companies are expected to hand over the list of selected candidates only to the authorized individuals of the Training & Placement Cell for further processing. In case a candidate receives multiple offers due to the overlap of placement drives/slots, he/she will have to choose one offer, and the final decision of the student will be communicated by the Training & Placement Cell to the company within 24 hours. The Training & Placement Cell strongly recommends that, in addition to the list of final selection, the participating companies also prepare a waiting list of the students. In case a student opts not to accept the offer, the students next on the waiting list may be confirmed as per their merit. This waiting list will not be disclosed to the students (by Training & Placement Cell or by the company) and will be released on a student basis if required. Once the offers are finalized, the company is required to send the offer letters to the Training & Placement Cell. The Training & Placement Cell will disseminate the offer letters to the selected students. The selected students will be required to accept the offer by signing the offer letter/acceptance letter in the required format (if provided) and submit the same to the Training & Placement Cell, which will forward it to the concerned company. Companies and students are expected to be in communication with each other ONLY through authorized officials/ individuals from the Training & Placement Cell and avoid direct contact during the placement drive except during the selection process. In case such a situation arises, please bring the incident to the notice of the authorized officials at the Training & Placement Cell immediately. The institute follows the ‘One Student-One Job’ policy. Once a student is offered a job, he/she is not allowed to further participate in the placement process. The participating companies are thus expected to honor their commitments in this regard relating to packages, profiles, location, and other such information, as informed in the JNF. Any downgrade from the stated information in JNF is strongly discouraged and will be dealt with on a case-to-case basis by the Training & Placement Cell. 5.0 Pre-Placement Offers (PPOs)  PPO should be routed through the T&P Cell only if the students receiving a Pre-Placement Offer (PPO) from any company are required to report it within 24 hours to the Training and Placement Office (T&P) at tnpoffice@nitkkr.ac.in and tpo@nitkkr.ac.in.  Once a PPO has been extended, the student must accept it within the specified time, and it will be counted as an offer, and the same rules of campus placement policy will be applicable. 6.0 Offer Upgrading Clause The institute follows the ‘ONE STUDENT ONE JOB’ policy. However, students may be given a chance to upgrade their offer in one additional company provided 80% of the branch is placed and offered CTC is higher than their current offer. The other limitation clauses for the second offer when branch placement is less than 80% are listed as follows: I. Job offers up to 5 LPA CTC will be considered as BONUS offers (will not be counted as offer). II. After 50% of the branch placement (excluding Bonus offer), students will be eligible for one additional company offering at least 1.5 times the current CTC. III. For PSUs, 40% of the branch placement is required to be eligible for a second offer (if the first offer is from PSU, then the student is not eligible for a second offer). 7.0 Offer Acceptance All Job Offers through campus placements MUST BE ACCEPTED. 1. Selected students will receive an email on their college email ID. They must accept the offer by replying to the email from the Training & Placement (T&P) Cell Office within the specified time after the result declaration. If the offer is not accepted within the given timeframe, the T&P Cell will inform the company, and the student will be disqualified from participating in any further placement processes. It is strongly recommended that students accept the offer promptly. 2. Students should not sign offer letters under any pressure from companies before formally accepting them via email to the T&P Cell. Any instances of pressure should be reported to the T&P Cell. 3. If two or more companies schedule interviews on the same day or in parallel, the student must accept the offer from the company that declares results first. The T&P Cell will notify the other companies of the student's selection, and the student's candidacy will be withdrawn from those companies. 8.0 Withdrawal procedure 1. Students are expected to submit their Expression of Interest only after thoroughly evaluating all relevant aspects of the company. Students who submit their Expression of Interest for an internship or placement drive are required to attend the Pre-Placement Talk (PPT). Failure to attend the PPT will be considered an absence, and the student will be disqualified from participating in any further stages of the company’s process. 2. Students may withdraw their Expression of Interest only after attending the PPT if they find that the organization does not align with their aspirations. If a student fails to attend the subsequent round after attending the PPT, they will be deemed to have withdrawn from the process. Once the selection procedure has begun, students cannot withdraw at any stage except under very exceptional circumstances. 3. If a company withdraws its offer for reasons beyond its control, affected students will be eligible for further opportunities, provided that an official communication from the company is received. Blacklisting of Company Any company, if it introduces new terms and conditions before or at the time of joining, upon the complaint of a student with sufficient proof, may be blacklisted from further participation in the placement sessions. 9.0 UG, PG Internship Guidelines (02 months, 06 months and 11 months) UG/PG Internship Guidelines The following guidelines will be applicable to the UG and PG students appearing for the internship drive. 1. The academic credentials of the students will be verified from the Academic Section by the T&P office. Any manipulations or alterations, will permanently debar the student from the internship drive. 2. The institute follows one student, one internship policy, regardless of the stipend paid. 3. As per the revised curriculum, the UG students shall be undergoing summer Internship (after 4th Sem. & 06th Sem.) and six-month Internship with job offer in their 8th semester. 4. All Pre-Placement Offers extended to students, by any organization, have to be immediately reported to the T&P cell by the student. The students who will accept the PPO shall be eligible for the second round of the placement process as per placement guidelines (refer clause 6.0). 5. In case, at any stage, the T&P cell is involved in any internship process (immaterial to the extent of participation of the T&P cell), that Internship will be considered as on campus and the T&P cell guidelines will be applicable on that process. 6. Consent from the respective M.Tech. Dissertation Supervisor through HoD is mandatory for the PG students to participate in the internship drive organized by T&P cell of the institute. All such expressions of interest should reach T&P cell by the end of December in the 1st semester. 7. For the companies which are offering PG internship for 7-12 months it will be mandatory for the industry to provide co-supervisor/project manager. 8. For the companies offering PG internship up to six months, or less, there will be no co supervisor/project manager from industry. 9. PG Internship/Project work in reputed Academic Institutions / R&D/ Government organizations will be allowed only after the recommendation of the concerned supervisor and HoD of the respective department. Students having internship in academic institutions / R&D / Govt. organizations will remain eligible for full time placement. 10. PG internship offers except in academic Institutions / R&D/ Government organizations will be considered equivalent to job offers. The second round of placement will commence (refer clause 6.0). 11. Dean (Academic) will approve PG internship cases only on the recommendation of Dean (R&C) and the selected candidates can join the concerned industry only after receiving the approval from the competent authority. 12. No scholarships will be provided by the institute during PG internship period, if it is paid. 13. M.Tech. students in the final year have the provision to pursue year-long internships adhering to the departmental permission. The internship timelines are strictly adhering to the academic timetable. Absence from academics for attending an industry internship is strictly not allowed. 14. MBA students are expected to undergo a summer internship of 06-08 weeks at the end of their second semester. 15. The Training & Placement cell shall also invite companies to provide internships to students. The process of selecting candidates shall be the same as followed for selecting the students for placements. 16. The policy applicable to the students for placements will also be applicable to the students seeking internship assistance. 17. The NOCs for the On-campus summer internships will be issued by the Faculty In-Charge (T&P Cell). 18. For Off-campus summer internships the reputation and the authenticity of the organization in which the student is willing to do the internship will be ensured by the Faculty Placement/Internship coordinator of the respective department. 19. The NOCs for the Off-campus summer internships will be issued by the Faculty Placement/Internship coordinator of the respective department. 20. If any student got the on-campus summer internship regardless of the stipend paid and if he/she rejects the on-campus internship to avail any another off-campus internship regardless of the stipend paid should be debarred for next semester from any on-campus Internship and Placement drives. 10.0 Guidelines for Off-Campus NOC for “Intern + FTE/PPO” Opportunities 1. Eligibility of the Student: I. The student must not have secured any on-campus placement offer, either "Intern + FTE /PPO" or "FTE". II. In case the student has already secured an on-campus offer (either "Intern + FTE /PPO" or "FTE"), NOC will not be granted until 80% of the branch has been placed. 2. Eligibility of the Company: I. The company offering the opportunity must be legally registered with the competent authority under the Companies Act of India, 2013. II. The company must have been established for at least four years from the date of its incorporation. III. In cases where the company is younger than four years, it must be a part of the Fortune 500 and/or Fortune India 500 list for the year 2024, as released by Fortune Magazine. 3. Mandatory compensation Criteria: I. The stipend for the internship should be equal to or greater than INR 35,000 per month, and the Cost to Company (CTC) must be equal to or greater than INR 8,00,000 per annum. 11.0 Student Code of Conduct 1. Students are expected to behave with the companies courteously, should not argue with the recruiters, and maintain decorum even under provocation. 2. No discussion with the recruiters regarding the selections/selection process should be done. 3. If there are any behavioral problems from the recruiter's side that students face, kindly inform the T&P immediately. Do not take action on your end. 4. If any behavioral problems are reported against any student, appropriate disciplinary action will be taken. Deviations from these standards will be considered misbehaviour and a violation of the student code of conduct. Such incidents will be treated seriously, with red flags issued as necessary. Severe breaches may result in additional disciplinary action and exclusion from the placement process. 12.0 Guidelines for Company 12.1 Offer letter: 1. The offer letter must be released preferably within one month from the date of the result declaration. In case of any deviations or inability to send the offers, a suitable update may be given to the Training and Placement Cell Office. 2. All offer letters are to be routed only through the Training and Placement Cell Office. In case of direct offers to the student, a copy must be sent to the Training and Placement Cell Office. 3. The joining date should not be deferred beyond 30th September. 4. In case a company is not in a position to honor the offer made or delays in joining (beyond October), it is liable to be debarred or black-listed. 12.2 Assessment process: 1. Companies are free to decide the mode of assessment tests, viz. through virtual/ online or through campus visits physically or a hybrid one. However, as a post-pandemic measure, we strongly encourage physical on- campus mode to bring back the lost social skills of the post-pandemic students. In case the mode of assessment is virtual / online, the companies are encouraged to arrange appropriate proctoring from their side. 2. Pre-Placement: PPOs / PPIs: This is for students selected as interns through the campus internship hiring process by the recruiters. After successful completion of the internship, the status of the PPOs should be informed within ten days of the completion of the internship. Companies are advised to leverage PPO instead of PPI in the best interest of all the stakeholders. 3. Unless the Organization has an explicit reservation policy and quota for the socio- economically disadvantaged groups (SEDG), soliciting JEE/GATE/CAT rank/score is strictly not entertained. The mere appearance of columns (even though as a non-mandatory field), seeking these ranks/ scores is viewed as discriminatory and not entertained. 12.3 Bond: Bonds as means of retention, in reality, act only as a deterrent to most students. However, if the policy of a company still requires signing a bond as part of the joining, it is mandated to specify the same. Further, a template of the content of the bond should also be made available along with the JNF. 12.4 CTC parity: 1. To have a healthy environment, a company is expected to quote uniform CTC for the same job profile across all NITs as well as for all students selected from the same institute. 2. CTC details: Companies are advised to give a clear, detailed breakup of the compensation, adding up to the first-year compensation. For example, details like medical insurance coverage may be shown separately, and only the premium paid may be included in the CTC. Similarly, ESOPs that could be vested beyond the first year should be shown separately and not added to first-year compensation, which is often misleading to a 20+-year- old student. More importantly, the peer pressure and societal pressure on CTC (often inflated) is found to cause severe undesirable mental stress on the students. 12.5 PWD and SLD Students: 1. If there are PwD applicants or Students with Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD), companies must take care of any of their special requirements, such as additional time, scribing bigger fonts, etc. 2. DEI: We encourage equal opportunity for all sections of the students with equal emphasis on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusivity. Quite often, DEI provisions start and end with Gender diversity. Companies are strongly recommended to go beyond and proactively consider and support PwD, SLD, and other such applicants. 3. Medical tests: If the company has stringent medical conditions such as color blindness, etc., it must be mentioned in the JNF. 13.0 Absenteeism Clause If any student, after applying for the placement drives, remains absent without any prior intimation through the Leave Application form (at least one day before), strict disciplinary action will be taken. The decision of disciplinary action will rest solely with the Dean (R&C) with the consultation of the committee constituted. In case of emergency, fill in the Leave Application form (LAF-Leave Application Form)- available on the T&P website, within working hours (9 AM – 5:00 PM) before the activity. You need to submit LAF in the Training and Placement Cell yourself or send a representative on your behalf with his/her undertaking on the form. You can also drop an e-mail with the filled LAF to tnpoffice@nitkkr.ac.in at least 3 hours before the start of the activity. Relevant proof needs to be attached with LAF for missing the event, which includes: i. NIT Kurukshetra Health Centre medical certificate for medical reasons. ii. If the class is scheduled at the placement drive time (if any), then the signature of the concerned teacher. iii. Other relevant proofs as per the reason. Following actions are decided to be taken for absenteeism cases in placement drives i. If the student is absent for the first time in any placement drive without any prior intimation as mentioned above. The student will be debarred from all placement drives till one month from the date of the incident. ii. If the student is absent for the second time in any placement drive without any prior intimation as mentioned above.
