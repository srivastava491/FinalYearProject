About Kurukshetra Kurukshetra is a place of great spiritual significance deeply steeped in history and mythology where Lord Krishna delivered the divine message of "Shrimad Bhagwad Gita". It is one of the premier centre of pilgrimage attracting devotees in a steady stream all- round year. Kurukshetra is very well connected by Rail (Delhi-Karnal-Ambala section), by Road (NH1 which connects Delhi-Chandigarh-Amritsar-Jammu) and by Air (Delhi 160 Km and Chandigarh 80 Km). The NIT Campus is about 10 km from Piplisituated on NH1and about 5 km from Kurukshetra railway station. About National Institute of Technology Kurukshetra (NITKKR) (Institution of National Importance) NITKKR(formerly known as Regional Engineering College, Kurukshetra in 1963) was conferred upon the status of Institution of National Importance (Deemed University) on June 26, 2002. The Institute has B.Tech.,M.Tech., MBA and MCA courses in various disciplines with annual intake of about 1500 students. Institute also offers excellent facilities for advanced research in the emerging areas of Science and Technology leading to Ph.D. degree. The institute has well-qualified and dedicated faculty along with splendid supporting staff, laboratories and other infrastructure.

IoT devices are often deployed in remote or battery-operated environments, necessitating stringent power constraints. VLSI designers employ a plethora of techniques such as voltage scaling, clock gating, and power gating to achieve ultra-low power consumption without compromising performance. Effective communication is a cornerstone of IoT connectivity, driving the need for energy-efficient transceivers and protocols. In this course, the VLSI Design aspect concerning power and area centric design will be covered in details. Course Contents  Basics of MOS Device  Device Circuit Co-design Principle  Nano scale device design  Internet of Things (IoT)  IIoT  IoT architectures  Communication Protocols for IoT systems  Lightweight Cryptography for IoT  Recent Trends in VLSI Interconnects  Low Power VLSI Design Resource Persons are from IITs, NITs and institute of repute.
