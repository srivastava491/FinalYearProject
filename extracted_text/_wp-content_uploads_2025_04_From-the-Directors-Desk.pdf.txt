Dear Students/Children (as I fondly wish to call you), I Felt like writing to you a long letter, and address you all children, on completing my third year this February 2025, as the Director and as I/C Chairman of MT Kurukshetra (hope you will read, as I was told current generation do not read or write long leners). Happy Earth Day: May we all strive to make Earth greener, cleaner, and more beautiful. "Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam" means all living beings on the earth is one family. The theme of G-20 presidency: one Earth, one Family, one Future. The theme ofthis year's Earth day 2025 celebrations is "Our Power, Our Planet." This year's theme highlights the collective strength of communities, individuals, and nations to protect and restore the planet through actionable, sustainable solutions. The focus is on tripling renewable energy generation by 2O3O and promoting a rapid transition to clean energy sources like solar, wind, hydroelectric, tidal, and geothermal power. Starting from our school days we have been given doses of how to protect environment and stop polluting our mother Earth. Who else can do it be, !!! pu the torchbearers of technology of tomorow. Take an oath for yourself to be a champion technocrat who will protect mother Earth. No to plastic ttsoge, no to littering, no to wastage of water, try take projects of recycling of waste, water, workfor sustainable energ) sources ond make your cqmpus an ecological modelfor others to emulate. It has been a fulfilling journey serving the interests of my future generation, particularly you, of this incredible institution and my heart is filled with gratitude, pride, and deep reflection. Being the alma mater and a faculty during my initial journey of life, in the very institute (then REC), it is nostalgic and a sense of pride to take the reins of the very institute (now NIT), the institute of national importance, as a captain. NIT Kurukshetra, erstwhile REC Kurukshetra is one ofthe oldest engineering Institute which is serving the Country in producing engineering professionals over the last 62 years. Three y.uit ago, I took an oath for myself, that it is payback time and I shall tirelessly work hard to achieve for a lO-year work output in 5-year term assigned to me. I walked into this organization with a vision: not just to lead, but to learn, grow, and build something meaningful with you. Further to achieve twin objectives of making you a holistic personality and inculcate sustainability in your thoughts and actions in transforming current technologies and future technologies into sustainable ones. After all, the seed for the nation building is sown in these very learning portals. Today, I can confidently say that this journey has been one of the most fulfilling chapters of my professional life. Each one of you have played apart in shaping that. I know that you have toiled really hard to make it to reach this NIT, and I know you may have aimed for still higher portals of learning and to enter a dream subject of your choice. Once you have taken admission, you have encountered a wonderful fully residential campus, spanning 300 acres, which is one of the greenest and well maintained campus, fulI of life and spaces to explore oneself in the lap of serene nature, full of all 5 elements in abundance and interesting climatic conditions which offer you all four seasons in its full bloom. Such lavishness is missing in many institutions of national importance and other universities. Remember this is also the sacred land, which has taught us Bhagavat Gita, the celestial song sung none other than by lord Krishna himself, who is embodiment of supreme knowledge. My initial thoughts and actions were directed to ensure, that you all are brought back to campus after the receding corona period and to make this institution a home away from home. To provide you a healthy environment, conscious decision was taken to make it a vehicle free green campus, free from polluting vehicles, bring in e-mobility, develop further greenery, recycle used water, rain harvesting, solar power generation and energy audit. Plans were made to make all covered pedestrian paths, cycle tracks and provide piped music in the campus for a soul stirring nourishing atmosphere which soothes your five senses, promotes development of overall personality and promote a healthy lifestyle, not only now but for a life time. It is also important to see that you are engaged all 2417 in providing means to develop your physical, mental, emotional, spiritual and social wellbeing. A recipe for to achieve a 3600 holistic personality development and learn to achieve a wonderful work-life balance. To this end, many a reforms are brought in your curriculum to include activities such as sports, clubs, yoga, meditation, NSS, NCC, Human values and professional ethics, as credit based courses in line with the new education policy 2020. Further there are many a recommendation in the policy document which have been introduced, some are to be introduced and some are at planning stage. For example, subjects like Indian Knowledge system (IKS), Vedic mathematics, 3 Indian languages such as Sanskrit, Telugu, Hindi and 3 foreign languages such as Spanish, German and French, human values and professional ethics, soft skills and thought lab have been included and have found space as audit courses. We are also encouraging the students to participate in community celebrations of festivals, celebrate annual events, visit places, industrial visits, present papers, attend hackathons, sports activities etc., sponsored by the institute. Offering engineering courses in mother tongue, such as Hindi and others are being explored. Recently to enhance your learning in multiple areas of your interest, your curriculum offers a mix and match baskets of courses to ensure your learning while focusing on a particular field allowing you to explore other interdisciplinary subjects. Schemes such as Minor desree offerings, Value added courses such as Design thinking and innovation, Entrepreneurship, soft skills, naturopathy etc., are being offered to achieve more credits and have two degrees in one go. Dear students, today, NIT Kurukshetra enrolls highest number of graduates among all NITs. During the last l0 years the student strength doubled studying UG, PG and PhD programmes at NIT Kurukshetra from about 3000 to 6132, though it is very heart warming, but definitely necessitates augmentation efforts related to faculty, staff and resources and we have future plans galore. To make your journey smooth, many a rules were revisited and or modified to ensure a smooth transition from your learning to achieving accolades and getting your degrees in time, being soft and sensible to your requirements and tough on your academic achievements. Student friendly rules and flexibility allowed. Besides schemes such as Academic Bank of Credits (ABC), Multiple entry and Multiple exit options to migrate from one institute to others is being explored. Schemes such as alignment to National Credit Frame Work(NCrF), Academic Bank of credits (ABC), Multiple Entry Multiple Exit plans, year gaps, interdisciplinary and multi-disciplinary approach etc., are being introduced in a planned way. My office and my communication channels tried to come very closely to you to ensure even a single child in the campus gets attention needed. I have watched you overcome challenges, celebrate victories, and grow not only in knowledge but in character, resilience, and compassion. Whether it was in the classroom, on the sports field, through cultural performances, or quiet moments of learning, your spirit has been the heartbeat of this organization. Taking note of your crowded class rooms, and future requirements, a two pronged strategy was adopted. One strategy was to prune your class strength to 60 as against 80,90,110 or beyond in each section. While the second was to introduce new engin'eering courses to cater to the work force requirements for the future. This gave us a leeway in introducing new courses and extend our B. Tech courses. You have started reaping the benefits of sweeping changes brought in by the introduction of eight (8) new B. Tech programmes, and strengthening the existing courses by revising all schemes and syllabus of all programmes aligning with NEP- 2020 guidelines. We have seen our academic programs evolve, with new courses and innovative teaching methods introduced as per NEP-2020 guidelines to keep pace with the rapidly changing world and the future requirements of the industry.

Three New PG programmes were started during 2023-24,Namely (l) M.Sc. (Physics), (2) M.Sc.(Chemistry), and (3) M.Sc. (Mathematics). This year we will be starting M.Sc. (Economics) from the academic sessi on 2025-26. To offer flexibility in learning as per NEP guidelines, 15 Minor degree programs are introduced for the benefit of students interested in honing their skills in other disciplines of their choice. Holding Convocation in time is eagerly looked forward by each student. We successfully conducted our 18tr and lgth Convocations of NIT Kurukshetra, during the years 2022 and 2024 in the august presence of Honorable President of India and Governor of Haryana, while distributingTl04 (Seven thousand one hundred and four) degree certificates both digital degrees as well as Hard copies. As students, you look forward to wonderful teachers who will help in studies, research activities and overall growth. Over these years, in all 150 new well qualified faculties were inducted into the system at the level of Assistant Professors. 05 Associate Professors were appointed as Professors. 08 professors had been upgraded to FIAG Scale. The process of recruitment of 77 faculties at various levels of Assistant Professor and Associate Professor is to be completed soon. Not only that plans are afoot to induct 200+ faculty to the existing strength. There will be a sea change in further improvements in teaching learning process and achieve academic excellence. Sufficient number of non-teaching persons are also recruited. Each one of you, eagerly looks forward to grab a campus placement and or a good internship offer that too in a dream company with very good pay package. An average of 80% students have been placed on campus, with highest package of l.l2 Crore per annum and the average package of 12.68 lakh per annum over the last 3 years. This may not be sufficient. My team of officers such as Dean IIR and Dean RC along with TPO looks forward to your contribution as brand ambassadors in further strengthening the placement team and ensure contribution of our own 40000+ alumnus in making NIT Kurukshetra a brand to reckon with. As students you all look for good rankings of the institute not only in India but global rankings. This genuinely requires consistent effons by all stake holders for all times. You are an important stake holder along with faculty, parents, employers and your alma mater and me at the helm of affairs. Taking ownership is the first step towards achieving excellence. The same is expected by all other stake holders. The Institute is faring well in NIRF ranking and has been consistently amongst top 100 institutions ofthe Country, however needs to improve its ranking. Accreditation agencies such as NAAC andNBA periodically evaluates the institute to achieve excellence. Rest assured that all our UG and PG programs are accredited. For many of you, R&D activities, publications, consultancy, patents may not enthuse you much as much as placements are, but for an institute they matter a lot for the future of technologies and furthering of knowledge and national growth.

How can you be behind in serving your own neighbourhood, it can be done through NITKKR local community connect: as a part of social responsibility NIT Kurukshetra can make a difference in participating in ways that can look forward to develop the village economy by identi&ing problem areas convert them to Minor and Major projects and dissertation works, there by finding practical solutions to the problems of the village. This can be done by voluntarily become foster parent, covering villages in the vicinity, through our NSS, NCC activities. We have faced our share of difficult times too - the uncertainty of the world outside, during corona period, the pressure of academic expectations, and the constant push to adapt and improve. There are many a problem of our students be it insufficient space in hostels, new all ICT classroom complexes, new Departments and new Laboratories, excellence centers, start-up culture, faculty housing and many more. But through it all, I see unity, courage, and the determination to rise above by all my stake holders, you, faculty and alumnus. NIT Kurukshetra, did have problems related to low FSR, low M.Tech. & ph.D. enrollments, low on publications, consultancy and patents, but now a thing of past.
