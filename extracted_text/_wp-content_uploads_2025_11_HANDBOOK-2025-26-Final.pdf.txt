The brief details of this system are given below: 1. Registration (a) Every student is required to register at the commencement of each semester on the dates fixed and notified by the Dean (Academic). The registration process is coordinated by the academic section of the Institute. The students submit the registration form (except in first semester) in their respective departments which is then forwarded to the academic section. (b) Only those students are permitted to register who have: i) Cleared all fees and dues of the Institute, library and Hostel (if resident). ii) Not been debarred from registering for a specified period on any ground by the competent authority. 2. Credit Counts All Courses have a credit count and teaching of subjects is reckoned in terms of credits. The number of credits of a course of are ordinary calculated as: (a) Lectures/Tutorials: One Lecture/Tutorial per week is assigned ONE/HALF credit. (b) Practical’s: One lab period per week is assigned HALF a credit. (c) Seminar/Colloquium/Group Discussion/Project: same as for practical. 3. EVALUATION PROCESS Based on the performance of a student in a course evaluated through class-work, two mid semester examinations and an end semester examination, a letter grade for that course for the semester is awarded to a student. Further, since each letter grade awarded to the student indicates the level of performance in that course, it has an assigned Grade Point for the purpose of computing the Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) as given below: Marks obtained &Letter Grade Performance Grade Point 85 ≤ A+ ≤ 100 Excellent 10 75 ≤ A < 85 Very Good 09 65 ≤ B < 75 Good 08 50 ≤ C < 65 Average 6.5 40 ≤ D < 50 Pass 4.5 0 ≤ F < 40 Re-appear 00 NIT KURUKSHETRA 36 Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) is the weighted average of all the grades and computed as follow: CGPA = ∑CiGi/∑Ci Ci denotes credits assigned to ith course and Gi indicates the Grade point equivalent to the Letter Grade obtained by the student to the ith course. The Percentage of marks obtained by a student can be calculated as = CGPA multiplying by 9.00. 1. Evaluation System Evaluation process for theory courses S.

All such students, depending upon their attendance shall be further categorized into two categories A & B, as follows: Category A: (Attendance between 50 % to 64.99 %) A student has two options Option 1: To repeat the course through classroom/lab studies and obtain whatever grade he/she can obtain. Option 2: Students are permitted to attend classes of the next semester and can appear for the mid-semester examinations of course(s) when the opportunity is available. However, such a student is restricted to a grade of ‘D’ only. Category B: (Attendance below 50%) Such students have to mandatorily repeat that/those course (s). In special cases, if any student is detained in the current semester in only one or two courses may be allowed to repeat the theory/lab course(s) through self- study and appear in the end semester exam of 100 marks in the upcoming (Odd/Even) semester. Chairman, Senate is authorized to take decision in this regard.

The core objectives of the club include:  Encouraging students to actively engage in community service.  Providing educational and emotional support to economically and socially disadvantaged groups.  Conducting awareness campaigns on social, environmental, and health-related issues.  Bridging the gap between students and the local community through outreach programs.

At SCSA, we firmly believe that education should not be confined to classrooms. Our outreach programs ensure that support and awareness reach the children who need it the most. NIT KURUKSHETRA 52 2.
