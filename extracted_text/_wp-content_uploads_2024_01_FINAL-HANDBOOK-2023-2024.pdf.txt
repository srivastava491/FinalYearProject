Ramana Reddy Director Message from Dean Students’ Welfare The office of the Dean Students’ Welfare congratulates and welcomes the batch of 2022 at the National Institute of Technology Kurukshetra. It gives me immense pleasure to inform you that the office is committed to work for the welfare of the students at various levels. Taking cognizance of the social, economic and cultural diversities, we strive to render all the facilities that will allow the young entrants to be enthusiastic and motivated to demonstrate their skills and talents. The office of the Dean Students’ Welfare ensures the overall growth of the students by providing ample of opportunities and a platform to the students to showcase and chisel their personality traits. We believe in maintaining a balance between academic and extracurricular activities as the aim of education is not only to support academic excellence but promote all round development of an individual—the holistic personality development—which suggests development of intellectual, psychological, physical, emotional and social skills to help an individual meet life’s demands and challenges. These skills are very critical to be successful in life—both at personal and at professional fronts. Hence, at National Institute of Technology Kurukshetra we have meticulously designed many innovative techniques, activities and workshops that will foster development of a balanced personality. Our focus is to promote value based education because “Education without morals is like a ship without a compass, merely wandering nowhere” (Martin Luther King Jr.). Therefore, students are involved in a variety of activities—sports, literary, cultural—including management and functioning of hostels which calls for demonstration of leadership skills and sensitivity to understand the needs of different stakeholders. This year we have constituted a ‘Student Council’ for encouraging students’ participation in maintaining discipline and sharing their ideas, interests and concerns. Thereby, initiating a culture of cooperation, fraternity, assimilation, accommodation and unity among the students further contributing towards strengthening of the social fabric of the nation. We are proud to inform you that the campus of the Institute is ragging free. The Institute follows the policy of zero tolerance towards incidents of ragging, substance abuse, eve teasing or any other criminal activity. Students are strictly warned to refrain from such activities and any person found guilty will be subjected to strict disciplinary action as per law. Physical violence or any other form of abusive behaviour towards fellow residents will not be tolerated within or outside the premises of the institute. Anyone found guilty of the same will be liable for strict disciplinary action to the extent of suspension or rustication as per case. I hope this handbook will provide all the necessary information about the institute. The principal objective of this office is to extend all possible aid for the growth and progress of the students. The office is always open for the students and we invite suggestions for improvement. I wish you a very happy, healthy and comfortable stay on the campus.

NIT KURUKSHETRA 131 VIDYA LAKSHMI PORTAL FOR SCHOLARSHIPS AND EDUCATIONAL LOANS With a view to enable all poor and middle class students to pursue higher education of their choice without any constraint of funds, the Govt. of India has set up a fully IT based Student Financial Aid Authority to administer and monitor Scholarship as well Educational Loan Schemes, through the Pradhan Mantri Vidya Lakshmi Karyakram. This is to ensure that no student misses out on higher education for lack of funds. The IT based mechanism provides to students a single window electronic platform for Scholarships and Educational Loans. Vidya Lakshmi is a first of its kind portal for students seeking Education Loan. This portal has been developed under the guidance of the Department of Financial Services, (Ministry of Finance), Department of Higher Education (Ministry of Human Resource Development) and Indian Banks Association (IBA). The portal has been developed and is being maintained by NSDL e-Governance Infrastructure Limited, Mumbai. This Portal is totally students-friendly and students can view, apply and track the education loan applications to banks anytime, anywhere by accessing the portal. The portal also provides linkages to the National Scholarship Portal. Those students who are interested to apply for educational loan and/or national scholarships may visit the Vidya Lakshmi Portal at www.vidyalakshmi.co.in NIT KURUKSHETRA 132 CASHLESS MEDICAL INSURANCE SCHEME The Institute has adopted Cashless Medical Insurance Scheme through United India Insurance Co. Ltd. for on-roll students of UG/PG/Ph.D (regular). The objective of this scheme is to provide enhanced hospitalization benefits to on-roll students of the Institute with full contribution and flexibility for treatment across the country. Students are required to pay the contribution amounting to Rs.500/- along with the fee as premium. The Insurance company will provide assured cover of Rs.1,00,000/- per student per year under the policy. The insurance company makes arrangements with an extensive network of reputed hospitals all across the country for treatment with cashless facilities. The list of hospitals is provided to the beneficiaries. Identity Cards are issued to all the students covered under the policy by the Insurance Company. For the academic session 2019-20, the Insurance Company has engaged United India Insurance Co. Ltd. , Kurukshetra, M/s.Vipul Medcorp TPA Pvt. Ltd, New Delhi for the Institute for this purpose. The General Administration Section of the Institute deals with the matters concerning insurance under this policy. NIT KURUKSHETRA 133 STUDENT MENTORSHIP PROGRAM The Student Mentorship Program has been introduced in the Institute from the academic session 2017-18 with the primary objective of enabling constructive and positive interaction, guidance and mentorship of students by the mentor faculty. Faculty mentors can play an integral role in observing and monitoring student progress and serve as guides throughout students' stay in the Institute. Besides, the peer-to-peer mentorship and tutoring also may work well, since students feel comfortable with other students. Accordingly, the B. Tech. students of each engineering department have been divided into groups, keeping in view the proportionate strength of the teachers of respective departments, with each group comprising almost equal number of students from second, third and final years. The number of students in each group is in the range of 15-20. Every next year the passing out final year B.Tech. students will be replaced by an equivalent number of new students entering second year in the branch. Each group is assigned one faculty mentor from the respective engineering department who will remain associated with the group, as mentor, for the entire duration of the stay of the student. Thus, the mentoring process emphasizes 'vertical' integration with senior students mentoring juniors and facilitating student- faculty interactions with faculty acting as mentors to the student groups. The B. Tech. first year students have been divided into groups, section-wise, to be mentored by the faculty members from the departments of Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Humanities & Social Sciences, as most of the courses in B.Tech. First years are related to and taught by these departments. The mentor-mentee process can help establish a close relationship with the students, orienting them regarding institution practices and monitoring their progress through semesters. Students in all four years may need this guidance as different problems develop at different times. The relationship is more informal than formal, allowing students to ask for help when they need it and share their problems without fear.The Faculty mentor could identify any academic or non-academic reasons for a student's weak or declining performance, and accordingly advise her/him on appropriate remedial measures. The Faculty mentor can also mediate between a student and other faculty, if necessary, or seek help from HoD, Dean, Director or any other official and get in touch with parents when necessary. The following guidelines are observed in the Mentor-Mentee process: ● The groups which are formed function as mentor- mentee networks. A student should feel free and be encouraged to approach his / her faculty mentor, when facing any kind of problem, whether academic / non-academic. ● Mentor faculty hold meetings with all the students in the group at least once in a month, except during vacations, and keep record of all such meetings and issues raised therein. ● The mentor faculty address the issues / complaints / concerns of the student(s) of the group and try to resolve / provide the solution, to the extent possible, with the help of the concerned faculty/staff/official of the Institute. ● The specific issues which require the attention of higher authorities, can be brought to the notice of higher authorities through the respective HoD for possible redressal / solutions. ● The name of the student(s) providing feedback / raising any specific issue, may not be disclosed, if it is so felt. NIT KURUKSHETRA 134 STUDENT'S COUNSELING In today's highly competitive environment, the growing pressure to excel in every sphere, often leads to psychological turmoil in a person. If we consider the case of engineering students, after the triumph in one of the toughest exams in the country, when the adolescent students enter the elite engineering institutions like IITs and NITs adjusting to the new environment and managing academic, personal and social demands, may induce high levels of stress and anxiety. In an institution of national importance like NIT Kurukshetra, which attracts students from all over the country and abroad, these stressful situations may surface all the more frequently, because a student is away from his/her protective social environment. There have been a few such cases in the Institute in the recent past. Although the teachers are generally available for mentoring and counselling, a specialized, professional approach was required to help students deal with specific psychological problems and execute appropriate follow-up procedures. Realizing the fact that a Counselor with professional training is much better equipped to help the students deal with a wide range of concerns, including tackling personal, emotional, family and peer related problems, as well as managing the challenges of maintaining a high level of academic performance, the appointment of a Counsellor – a qualified psychotherapist – was, therefore, considered very necessary. Psychological issues are not limited to the students alone; the faculty, the staff and their dependents often succumb to the rigors of life and seek expert advice in overcoming them. Therefore, for them as well, the service of a professional Counsellor is most desirable. In view of the above, a qualified Counsellor- Dr. Chhaya Tomar, having Ph.D Degree in Clinical Psychology; MA(Psychology); Advanced Diploma in child Guidance & Counselling and PG Diploma in Mass Communication, has been engaged on contract basis for a period of one year, who is providing counselling services to the students of the Institute. Establishment of Thought Laboratory in the Institute: In the wake of recent upheavals in the society-crime against children & women, massive drug abuse in today’s youth, alarming suicide rates among young adults, widespread depression to the extent of becoming W.H.O.’s major concern is but tip of ice berg in the life of a child, adolescent and young adult and the challenges faced by them are many and the current technological tools are adding fuel to fire. The present education system teaches how to read, write and speak but does not focus on emotional strength. So, there is a lack of achievement in behavioral, management and social skills from this learning. In order to bridge this gap, there is scope for all-round Personality Development in National Education Policy 2020. Therefore, a Thought Laboratory has been set up in our institute which was inaugurated by Hon’ble Governor of Haryana on 10.05.2022. The idea of Thought Lab is to train people on how to cultivate positive and creative thoughts and contribute positively at their own homes, organizations and within society on the whole. NIT KURUKSHETRA 135 Brief introduction of Thought Laboratory is given below.
