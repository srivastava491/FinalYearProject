However, these natural disasters can be managed and their effects can be minimized by flood modeling performed before the occurrence of a flood. Flood hazard and risk maps were prepared by using GIS and HEC-RAS. In recent years, the integrated use of geographic information systems (GIS) with hydrological and hydraulic modeling has significantly improved numerical flood modeling. The HEC- GeoRAS, a tool of HEC-RAS, uses mathematical equations to calculate river bed coefficients based on river water flow rate, the amount of drainage, and the rate at which water enters the soil. Flood modeling is a technical method for obtaining high-accuracy information regarding important flood factors such as runoff, storage, and velocity. In this course, flood modeling using GIS and HEC-RAS will be covered in detail and hands-on problems will be discussed. Course Contents • Basics of GIS and HEC-RAS • Data extraction using Python • Open data sources for water resources development and management • Introduction to hydrologic modeling and its role in flood management. • Floodplain mapping and analysis using HEC- RAS • Application of HEC-RAS for flood risk assessment and management Tentative Resource Persons • Dr. Shray Pathak, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Ropar • Dr. Arun Mondal, Assistant Professor, University of Allahabad, Prayagraj, U.P • Dr. Surendra Kumar Chandniha, Assistant Professor, BRSM & Research Station, Mungeli, Pin-495334, Chhattisgarh • Dr. Harinarayan Tiwari, Managing Director, Floodkon, NOIDA • Dr. Dheerej Kumar Sharma, Assistant Professor, NIT Kurukshetra • Dr. Ajay Krishna Prabhakar, Assistant Professor, NIT Kurukshetra • Dr. K K Singh, Professor, NIT Kurukshetra Who should attend Faculty members/research scholars / PG students from academic institutes approved by the AICTE /UGC /MHRD and Scientists / Engineers working in private / Public/ Govt. organizations/industries etc. can attend the course.
